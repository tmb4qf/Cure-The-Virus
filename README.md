Cure The Virus
==============
The problem being solved is given in ProblemStatement.txt. This problem was featured at a Microsoft Coding Challenge hosted at my school(hence, why the problem statement specifies Redmond).

The program takes an input file containg all the citizens DNA and the virus DNA and then outputs each citizen with a batch number based on when they should be vaccinated(see ProblemStatement.txt).

Feel free to create new input files to test with or suggest new implementations(I'm sure there's more efficent ones out there). Shoot me an email with questions or comments! 1/4/15
